# RTO-ROS 2 Humble

This repository contains code for packages that enable ROS 2 support for the **Festo Robotino 3**.

This repo is verified to work on a host laptop which had Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with ROS2 Humble.

The original code was taken from [dietriro's robotino repository](https://github.com/dietriro/rto_core) and adapted for ROS2 and this repo is forked from [Rahul-K-A's robotino ros2 repository](https://github.com/Rahul-K-A/robotino-ros2) and adapted for ROS2 Humble.

**Note:** Not all functionality has been enabled. North Star support, BHA support, and gripper support have been disabled.
